# Windows Autopilot licensing requirements

**Applies to: WindowsÂ 10**

Windows Autopilot depends on specific capabilities available in Windows 10 and Azure Active Directory; it also requires an MDM service such as Microsoft Intune. These capabilities can be obtained through various editions and subscription programs:

-   Windows 10 version 1703 or higher must be used. Supported editions are the following:
    -   Pro
    -   Pro Education
    -   Pro for Workstations
    -   Enterprise
    -   Education
-   One of the following, to provide needed Azure Active Directory (automatic MDM enrollment and company branding features) and MDM functionality:
    -   Microsoft 365 Business subscriptions
    -   Microsoft 365 F1 subscriptions
    -   Microsoft 365 Enterprise E3 or E5 subscriptions, which include all Windows 10, Office 365, and EM+S features (Azure AD and Intune)
    -   Enterprise Mobility + Security E3 or E5 subscriptions, which include all needed Azure AD and Intune features
    -   Azure Active Directory Premium P1 or P2 and Intune subscriptions (or an alternative MDM service)

Additionally, the following are also recommended but not required:
-   Office 365 ProPlus, which can be deployed easily via Intune (or other MDM services)
-   [Windows Subscription Activation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-10-enterprise-subscription-activation), to automatically step up devices from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise
