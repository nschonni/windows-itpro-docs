# Windows Autopilot configuration requirements

**Applies to: WindowsÂ 10**

Before Windows Autopilot can be used, some configuration tasks are required to support the common Autopilot scenarios.  

-   Configure Azure Active Directory automatic enrollment.  For Microsoft Intune, see [Enable Windows 10 automatic enrollment](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/windows-enroll#enable-windows-10-automatic-enrollment) for details.  If using a different MDM service, contact the vendor for the specific URLs or configuration needed for those services.
-   Configure Azure Active Directory custom branding.  In order to display an organization-specific logon page during the Autopilot process, Azure Active Directory needs to be configured with the images and text that should be displayed.  See [Quickstart: Add company branding to your sign-in page in Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/customize-branding) for more details.  Note that the "square logo" and "sign-in page text" are the key elements for Autopilot, as well as the Azure Active Directory tenant name (configured separately in the Azure AD tenant properties).
-   Enable [Windows Subscription Activation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/deployment/windows-10-enterprise-subscription-activation) if desired, in order to automatically step up from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Enterprise.

Specific scenarios will then have additional requirements.  Generally, there are two specific tasks:

-   Device registration.  Devices need to be added to Windows Autopilot to support most Windows Autopilot scenarios.  See [Adding devices to Windows Autopilot](add-devices.md) for more details.
-   Profile configuration.  Once devices have been added to Windows Autopilot, a profile of settings needs to be applied to each device.  See [Configure Autopilot profiles](profiles.md) for details.  Note that Microsoft Intune can automate this profile assignment; see [Create an AutoPilot device group](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/enrollment-autopilot#create-an-autopilot-device-group) and [Assign an AutoPilot deployment profile to a device group](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/enrollment-autopilot#assign-an-autopilot-deployment-profile-to-a-device-group) for more information.

See [Windows Autopilot Scenarios](windows-autopilot-scenarios.md) for additional details.
