# Create tests using Microsoft Forms
**Applies to:**

-   WindowsÂ 10   


For schools that have an Office 365 Education subscription, teachers can use [Microsoft Forms](https://support.office.com/article/What-is-Microsoft-Forms-6b391205-523c-45d2-b53a-fc10b22017c8) to create a test and then require that students use the Take a Test app to block access to other computers or online resources while completing the test created through Microsoft Forms.

To do this, teachers can select a check box to make it a secure test. Microsoft Forms will generate a link that you can use to embed into your OneNote or class website. When students are ready to take a test, they can click on the link to start the test.

Microsoft Forms will perform checks to ensure students are taking the test in a locked down Take a Test session. If not, students are not permitted access to the assessment.
